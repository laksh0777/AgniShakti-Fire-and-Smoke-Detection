Agnishakti, is an intelligent, comprehensive Fire Safety System engineered for real-time fire and smoke detection. It leverages the advanced YOLOv8s model for superior accuracy and efficiency. A key feature of our system is its seamless integration with existing CCTV cameras, which are already ubiquitous, enabling high scalability without additional hardware costs.
Upon detecting a fire, Agnishakti instantly captures a snapshot of the incident and utilizes GPS navigation to dispatch a detailed alert to the nearest fire station and the property owner. To ensure proactive monitoring and management, the system incorporates a role-based login and a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes incidents on a society map, providing a clear overview of potential threats.
